# decks
[Decker](https://beyondloom.com/decker) decks, modules and scripts written in Lil.

`index.deck` is generated using a deck skeleton and `gen.lil`. Lil is designed beautifully to allow one to effectively build
static sites purely with in-house functionality from decker. See `readdeck[]` and `writedeck[]` in the
[lilt manual](https://beyondloom.com/decker/lilt.html) for more details.

Accessible on the web at https://razetime.github.io/decks/.
